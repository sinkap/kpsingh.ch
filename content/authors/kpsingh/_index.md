I am a Senior Software Engineer working for Google in ZÃ¼rich. You might also know me as **Kapileshwar Singh**.

I joined Google as an SRE and  worked in Apps and Production Security. I was also one of the core engineers who created a Google wide production platform. I have deep rooted interests in Operating Systems and the Linux Kernel.

I am currently working on the Upstream Linux Kernel on [Kernel Runtime Security Instrumentation](https://lssna19.sched.com/event/RHai).

*PS: Yes, it's totally okay (and preferred) that you address me as* **KP**.
